###  <ins>_**Drinking:**_</ins>

After fulfilling some condition(s), the datapack will decide which players drink in one of four ways:

- *EVERYONE* except the player who triggered the condition has to drink
- *EVERYONE* has to drink regardless of who triggered the condition
- *YOU* have to drink if you triggered a particular condition
- *A RANDOM PERSON* is selected to drink other than yourself upon triggering a condition

>[!WARNING]
>This is <ins>*NOT*</ins> meant to be a shot every time unless you decide otherwise for major events like beating the game. There are a lot of conditions that will trigger and you would possibly *DIE* ðŸ˜†
>
>Pick something to sip.

### <ins>Types of Conditions:</ins>

- Visiting certain biomes or structures for the first time
- Selected items that trigger conditions when picked up or crafted
- Mining certain blocks
- Killing types or amounts of mobs
- Travelling dimensions
- Using certain items
- Parts of the game progression
- Dying
- Taking damage
- etc.

>[!NOTE]
>For the best experience, go into the datapack without anyone knowing what triggers the drink events, as it's supposed to be unpredictable and somewhat random to distribute the drink events.
